=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Date::Gregorian::Business> is an extension of Date::Gregorian supporting
date calculations involving business days.

Objects of this class have a notion of whether or not a day is a
business day and provide methods to count business days between two
dates or find the other end of a date interval, given a start or
end date and a number of business days in between.  Other methods
allow to define business calendars for use with this module.

By default, a date interval includes the earlier date and does not
include the later date of its two end points, no matter in what order
they are given.  We call this "morning alignment".  However, individual
date objects can be either "morning" or "evening" aligned, meaning they
represent the situation at the beginning or end of the day in question.
Where a date object is the result of a calculation, its alignment can
be chosen through an optional method argument.

=head2 User methods

I<new>, called as a class method, creates and returns a new date
object.  The optional parameter can be a configuration or (more
typically) the name of a configuration.  If omitted, the current
default configuration is used.  Business calendar configurations
are described in detail in an extra section below.  In case of bad
configurations B<undef> is returned.

I<new>, called as an object method, returns a clone of the object.
A different configuration for the new object can be specified.
Again, in case of bad configurations B<undef> is returned.

I<is_businessday> returns a nonzero number (typically 1) if the
date currently represented by the object is a business day, or zero
if it falls on a weekend or holiday.  Special business calendars
may have business days counting less than a whole day in calculations.
Objects configured that way may return 0.5 or even another numeric
value between 0 and 1 for some dates.  In any case I<is_businessday>
can be used in boolean context.

I<align> sets the alignment of a date.  An alignment of 0 means
morning alignment, 1 means evening alignment.  With morning alignment,
the current day is counted in durations extending into the future,
and not counted in durations extending from that date into the past.
Mnemonic is, in the morning, a day's business lies ahead, whereas
in the evening, it lies behind.  Night workers please pardon the
simplification.

There are two methods to count the number of business days between
two dates.  Their only difference is the sign of the result:
I<get_businessdays_since> is positive if the parameter refers to
an earlier date than the object and business days lie between them,
zero if no business days are counted, and negative otherwise.  Note
the role of alignments described in the previous paragraph.
I<get_businessdays_until> is positive when I<get_businessdays_since>
is negative and vice versa.  The parameter may be an arbitrary
Date::Gregorian object.  If it is not a Date::Gregorian::Business
object its alignment is taken to be the default (morning).

I<set_next_businessday> moves an arbitrary date up or down to the
next business day.  Its parameter must be one of the four relation
operators ">=", ">", "<=" or "<" as a string.  ">=" means, the date
should not be changed if it is a business day, or changed to the
closest business day in the future otherwise.  ">" means the date
should be changed to the closest business day truly later than the
current date.  "<=" and "<" likewise work in the other direction.
Alignment does not matter and is not changed.

I<add_businessdays> moves an arbitrary date forward or backwards
in time up to a given number of business days.  A positive number
of days means moving towards the future.  The result is always a
business day.  The alignment will not be changed if the second
parameter is omitted, or else set to the second parameter.  The
result will be rounded to the beginning or end of a business day
if necessary, as determined by its alignment.

Rounding: If you work with simple calendars and integer numbers,
all results will be precise.  However, with calendars containing
fractions of business days or with non-integer values of day
differences, a calculated date may end up somewhere in the middle
of a business day rather than at its beginning or end.  The final
result will stay at that date but move up or down to the desired
alignment.  In other words, fractional days will be rounded down
to morning alignment or up to evening alignment, whichever applies.

No ambiguities: Even if a calculated date lies next to a number of
non-business days in a way that more than one date would satisfy a
desired span of business days, results are always well-defined by
the fact that they must be business days.  Thus, morning alignment
will pull a result to the first business day after weekends and
holidays, while evening alignment will pull a result to the last
business day before any non-business days.  If you add zero business
days to some arbitrary date you get the unique date of the properly
aligned business day next to it.

I<get_alignment> retrieves the alignment (either 0 for morning or
1 for evening).

=head2 Configuration

Version compatibility note: The configuration specifications described
here are expected to evolve with further development of this module.
In fact, they should ultimately be replaced by easier-to-use
configuration objects.  We will try to stay downward compatible for
some time, however.

The business calendar to use can be customized both on an
object-by-object basis and by way of general defaults.  Business
calendars can be stored under a name and later referenced by that
name.

A business calendar can be defined through a list of holiday
definitions or more generally through a code reference, as explained
below.  A number of such definitions of common interest will be
accessible in later editions of this module or some related component.

I<define_configuration> names and defines a configuration.  It can
later be referenced by its name.  By convention, user-defined names
should start with an uppercase letter, while configuration names
provided as a part of the distribution will always start with a
lowercase letter.

I<configure_business>, used as an object method, re-configures that
object.  It returns the object on success, B<undef> in case of a
bad configuration.

I<configure_business>, used as a class method, defines the default
configuration for new objects created with neither a configuration
parameter nor a reference object.  It returns the class name on
success, B<undef> in case of a bad configuration.

The configuration parameter for I<define_configuration>, I<new> and
I<configure_business> can be the name of a known configuration, an
array reference or a code reference.  A configuration name must be
known at the time it is used, for it is always immediately replaced
by the named configuration.

An array reference used as a configuration has to refer to a
two-element array like this:

  $configuration = [\@weekend_days, \@holidays];

Here, C<@weekend_days> is a list of the non-business days of every
week, given as numerical values as defined in I<Date::Gregorian>.
For example:

  use Date::Gregorian qw(:weekdays);
  @weekend_days = (SATURDAY, SUNDAY);

The list of weekend days may be empty, but must not contain all
seven days of the week, which would imply that the whole week has
no business days and thus be the reason for endless loops.

The second element of a configuration is a list of holiday definitions.
Each one of these defines a yearly recurring event like this:

  $holiday = [$month, $day, $weekday_shift, $valid_years];

Here, C<$month> and C<$day> with month ranging from 1 to 12 define
an anniversary by date.  Alternatively, month may be zero and day
a signed integer value defining a date relative to Easter Sunday.
For example, C<[0, -2]> would refer to Good Friday (two days before
Easter Sunday) while C<[0, 1]> would refer to Easter Monday.  The
distance from Easter Sunday must be in the range of (roughly)
C<-81..250> to make sure the actual date is a day of the same year.

If C<$weekday_shift> is omitted or undefined, a holiday occurs on
a fixed month and day (or distance from easter), no matter what day
of the week it falls on.  In order to shift it dependent on the
weekday, C<$weekday_shift> must be a reference of a seven-element
array of days to add, ordered from Monday to Sunday.  Examples:

  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1] # Saturday and Sunday -> next Monday

  [0, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] # any day other than Monday -> next Monday

  [3, 2, 1, 0, 6, 5, 4] # any non-Thursday -> next Thursday

The last two examples above show how holidays can be defined that
always fall on the same day of the week.  To continue the example,
Thanksgiving Day could be defined like this:

  $thanksgiving = [11, 22, [3, 2, 1, 0, 6, 5, 4]];

The fourth element of a holiday definition is also optional and
limits the years the definition is valid for.  It may be either:

=over 4

=item *

a plain number, defining the single year the definition is valid,

=item *

a reference of a two-element array, defining the first and
the last year of a range of years, where B<undef> means
no limit,

=item *

a reference of a subroutine taking a year and returning a boolean
for whether the holiday is valid in that year.

=back

A more general way to specify a complete configuration is a code
reference.  It must refer to a subroutine that takes a date object
and a year (which you can also view as a method with a year parameter)
and returns an array reference.  The array must have exactly that
many elements as there are days in the given year.  Each element
must be defined and have a numerical value greater or equal to zero.
These values will be returned by I<is_businessday> and added together
in calculations.  The idea is that one call to the subroutine figures
out the calendar of a whole year in one go.

I<get_empty_calendar> is a helper method mainly intended for use
in such a subroutine.  It takes two mandatory parameters, a year
and a reference to an array like C<@weekend_days> above, and returns
a reference of an array of zeroes and ones representing the weekends
and weekly business days of that year suitable to be further modified
and finally returned by said subroutine.
