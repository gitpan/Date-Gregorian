Version
-------

This is Version 0.08 of Date::Gregorian.

DSLI status
-----------

bdpO (beta, developer, perl, object-oriented)

This package is free software; you can distribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself.

Description
-----------

Date::Gregorian performs date calculations, similar to Date::Calc
by Steffen Beyer.  However, it has a pure object-oriented interface,
it does not use C code, and it extends the Gregorian calendar beyond
some configurable date in the past by its predecessor, the Julian
calendar.  See the inline POD documentation for more details.

Y2K compliance
--------------

This package does not use nor permit two-digit abbreviations for
four-digit year numbers anywhere.  In fact, it is designed to deal
with dates in many different centuries.

Prerequisites
-------------

Perl 5.

Installation
------------

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

Changes
-------

Since its first release, no major changes have been made to the
module's basic interface.  Version 0.07 finally introduced the
Date::Gregorian::Business extension.  For a detailed history of
changes, see the Changes file.

Future enhancements
-------------------

The oversimplifying Date::Gregorian::Exact extension is considered
deprecated and most likely will drop out of the distribution at
some point.  Look into the DateTime suite of modules for a more
comprehensive approach to handling timestamps and localization.

More samples of business calendars and better ways to define even
more of them will be added next.

Fractional business days are an experimental feature so far.
Their semantics are subject to further scrutiny.

More suggestions are welcome.
